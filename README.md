This idea is new to your year, so you'll need to wait to hear more information, on what comes next. So at the moment. To be confirmed ...

### :hammer: Start your own projects

Creating and building yoyr own projects, enables you to gain more independence, and that is what employers and engineering managers want. It means you have learn the HARD way, and started.

This one is probably the most difficult.

\[ To be confirmed \]

## :turtle: Start applying soon

2. The sooner you can get your CV out there. Get it checked employers and recruiters.
3. The sooner you get your first phone call.

### :no_mouth: Do I need a degree?

No. If recruiters are more concerned if you have a degree, it's because;

- It makes their life and their job easier to sell you companies
- More concern with arbituary education, than your ability to problem solve. It's true

Stop and think about it, has their ever been

### :neutral_face: I don't have a computer science degree?

A computer science degree or not, you all have decided to this to do this Bootcamp and a lot of people who do join come from different backgrounds anyway.

What mainly matters are your soft skills, how easier it is for others to work with you and how well can you fit into the companies culture.

Your problem solving skills, believe it or not, more of software engineering is NOT code. Coding is a medium to help you to solve a problem, not everything revolves around it.

Meaning writing less code to solve a problem is good, writing **zero code** to solve a problem is **best**.

### :sweat: I keep getting rejected

This is the hardest for anyone, it can be demoralising even at the best of times.

Remember that we are even here to support you in anyway we can. Especially emotionally, the volunteers are to here support, and guide you guys.

### :anguished: I see others get a job before me

## :angry: Don't try to do all these at once!

This is far the most important one. Stick to one thing, focus on it and its entirety the best you can, then move on, another thing that get you closer to getting employed.

Doesn't have to be in this particular order;

- Learning - start building projects with your team or on your own
- Good enough portfolio - real doesn't have to be perfect
- Good CV
  - Try to make it one page, as you want to be as concise and precise as possible
  - With most important details top.
  - Note that Recruiters have get through 100s or 1000s of applicants at time
  - Other details about you can placed on LinkedIn or your Portfolio site

What you don't want to happen, was that you haven't finished your CV drafts, a portfolio with a few or half-finished projects and expect to employed, because you didn't practice enough for your interview.
